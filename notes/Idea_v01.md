Exploratory Data Investigation of KV 25

##### Main Aim: 

To build a simple suite of tools to explore the candidates of the KV25 election in Denmark. The first tool is a basic web scraper to get the data from DR.DK. The second tool is a visualisation tool that uses the 19 or so questions, the 3 key issues, and demographic info, letting the viewer interactively explore where the different candidates overlap and differ on the questions, and analyse the sentiment of their answers across basic demographics and party lines. The visualisations are envisioned to be network-like in terms, allowing users to cluster and explore the overlaps. Additionally, the election results will be incorporated into the visualisations.

The project may focus on Østdanmark and the greater Copenhagen area to start with.

##### Deliverables

Software tools

Report in the form of a short scientific paper,  8 pages with references
